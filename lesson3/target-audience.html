The residents of these areas are mostly older people aged 50-90, who have lived in the area their whole life and value Idaho’s farming history. Most are now retired, but were earning an income of around 50,000, Since the demographic is older they need a website that is easy to navigate and with relatively large fonts sizes for easy readability.
